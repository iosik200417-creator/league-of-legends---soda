            This project is a high-end fictional branding 
            concept deeply inspired by the vibrant universe
            of League of Legends and its iconic Valentine's 
            Day skin lines. I have meticulously created a 
            limited-edition soda collection that brings the 
            essence of Runeterra into the real world, focusing 
            on four fan-favorite champions: Lux, Jinx, Ekko, and 
            Ezreal. Each beverage is more than just a drink; it 
            is a sensory experience represented through a unique 
            flavor profile, a distinct visual identity, and a 
            charismatic personality that resonates with the gaming 
            community.

            The core objective of this ambitious project was to 
            push the boundaries of character-based product design 
            and retail aesthetics. By developing a cohesive brand 
            identity for "Charm Pop," I aimed to blend the fantastic, 
            glowing aesthetics of modern gaming with playful, vibrant, 
            and premium packaging. This collection explores how digital 
            character traits can be translated into tangible consumer 
            goods, resulting in a product drop that feels both exclusive 
            and deeply connected to the game's lore.
          </p>

            Every single flavor was carefully engineered and matched 
            to the champion's specific personality, signature color 
            palette, and dynamic in-game energy. From the chaotic 
            zing of Jinx’s wild flavors to the elegant sweetness of 
            Lux’s radiance, we have created a powerful emotional 
            connection through taste, avant-garde design, and 
            immersive storytelling. This series invites fans to not 
            just play their favorite characters, but to experience 
            their essence in a whole new, refreshing way.
